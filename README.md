# Precipitation--codechef
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
In Chefland, precipitation is measured using a rain gauge in millimetre per hour.

Chef categorises rainfall as:

LIGHT, if rainfall is less than 
3
3 millimetre per hour.
MODERATE, if rainfall is greater than equal to 
3
3 millimetre per hour and less than 
7
7 millimetre per hour.
HEAVY if rainfall is greater than equal to 
7
7 millimetre per hour.
Given that it rains at 
X millimetre per hour on a day, find whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.
## Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer 
X â€” the rate of rainfall in millimetre per hour.
## Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, whether the rain is LIGHT, MODERATE, or HEAVY.

You may print each character in lowercase or uppercase. For example, LIGHT, light, Light, and liGHT, are all identical.

## Constraints
   1<=T<=20
   1<=X<=20
## Sample 1:
## Input    Output
    1        LIGHT
    20       HEAVY
    3        MODERATE
    7        HEAVY

## Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The rate of precipitation is less than 
3
3. Thus, the rain is LIGHT.

Test case 
2
2: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 
7
7. Thus, the rain is HEAVY.

Test case 
3
3: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 
3
3 and less than 
7
7. Thus, the rain is MODERATE.

Test case 
4
4: The rate of precipitation is greater than equal to 
7
7. Thus, the rain is HEAVY.
